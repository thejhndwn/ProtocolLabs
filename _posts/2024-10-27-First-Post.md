I need to go pick up my brother from the airport so i'll have to make this quick. I'm creating this blog PRIMARILYj because I was inspired by [Sholto Douglas' blog](https://sholtodouglas.github.io/) as well as many others. In fact I already had a blog which should still be up, hosted on Blogger, which was more of a personal diary.

I am replacing its intention with this one - somewhere I can post my thoughts and have my own space. Primarily to keep my work and thoughts in an archive for myself and other interested parties, if they exist. 
I always asked myself what exactly is research and what is the meaning of life. Surely the meaning of life can't be to be stuck behind a book or a computer trying to advance humanity, sacrificing one's own life for the betterment of mankind which will never be recognized. Noble, but sad. 
I want to be a little greedy, in my past I would say I was quite reserved - and upset with it. I never felt motivated, except to prove others wrong, and to that point never been quite passionate about anythiing except for the instant hit of dopamine or recognition. 
My last few years have been spent as a SWE working for a FAANG company and it was extremely ungratifying. I knew it couldn't do it for the rest of my life, but by that point I knew that I was capable of such. That was a big turning point for me. In the past I was plagued with is it possible and I've always wanted to push those boundaries,
but also was concerned if I was pushing the right target. I was dissatisfied with the goals of the people around me and found a great community of like-minded individuals online and I would like to join their noble pursuit of the mearning of life, artificial life, and to have some greater purpose.

Anyways I'm late enough as it is. one dle plus one dle equals, twodles!
